# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
To capture live network traffic and analyze basic network protocols using Wireshark.

## Tool Used
- Wireshark (free network packet analyzer)

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark and restarted the system to enable packet capture drivers.
2. Started packet capture on the active Wi-Fi interface.
3. Generated network traffic by browsing websites and using the ping command.
4. Stopped the capture after about one minute.
5. Applied display filters to analyze different protocols.
6. Saved the captured traffic as a .pcapng file.

## Protocols Identified
- **DNS**: Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- **ICMP**: Used for network connectivity testing (ping).
- **TCP**: Provides reliable, connection-oriented data transmission.

## Files Included
- "capture.pcapng" – Packet capture file
- "Packet capturing.png" - Packet capturing screenshot
- "DNS.png" - DNS protocol filtering
- "ICMP.png" - ICMP protocol filtering

## Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in packet capturing, protocol filtering, and basic network traffic analysis using Wireshark.
